"""Per display configuration, and the one setting of NVDA's own the add-on has to obey.

Settings are stored per display rather than globally, because the useful layout differs
sharply between displays: an 8 row Monarch and an 80 cell single row Focus want different
segment counts, and reversed panning keys are wanted on one and not the other.

Displays are keyed on driver name plus geometry, since the same driver can present
different sized displays.

L{isSpeechOutputMode} is the exception: it is NVDA's setting rather than this add-on's, and
lives here because every place that has to consult it reads its configuration through this
module already.

- `reverseScrollBtns`: swap the panning keys. NVDA has no such setting of its own.
